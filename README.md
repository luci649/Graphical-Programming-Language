This project was created to utilise a form for taking in one command at a time and/or multiple lines of commands at a time that once the correct command or button is executed so 
is the command, with it's result displayed in the display. The commands result in move the pen used to draw a line, a two-dimensional shape, change the fill setting, and colour. 
Along with the simple commands there are also more complex commands that works as pseudo programming language that allowes for varibles, if statements, loop statements, and 
equations. With the implementation of this programming language is a syntax button that is used to check the syntax of program written in the textbox. Finally with the use of 
threads a second textbox allowes for multiple programs to be executed and displayed at the same time.
